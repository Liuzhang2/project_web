Drawing upon the psychological and operational adjustments of tourism personnel in the face of global crises highlighted by Simanjuntak and Fitriana (2020), this research will further examine the strategic incorporation of traditional cultural elements in enhancing tourism appeal, as evidenced by Simanjuntak and Fitriana (2020). Additionally, it will delve into the linguistic and cultural challenges and opportunities in the digital localization of tourism websites discussed by Cappelli et al. (2007), complemented by an investigation into the role of local tour guides in mediating global and local cultural exchanges, as analyzed by Salazar (2005). Lastly, the study will consider the digital localization practices of national tourism organizations and their impact on cultural tourism, following insights from Mele and Cantoni (2017). Collectively, these references will underpin a comprehensive model aimed at fostering sustainable tourism development that prioritizes cultural integrity, inclusiveness, and adaptability to changing global trends.",
